							<u>First experience with Garry's Mod</u>
							<p>When I first got my own computer in 2014, the first game I downloaded and played on steam was Garry's Mod. This was mainly due to the fact it was one of the only games my computer could run, but also due to the depth of gamemodes and servers inside of the game itself. It was an easy way in to online multiplayer games with my friends. However, as I started to enjoy my PC more, I started to upgrade it too. This meant I started moving on to many different games, although I knew GMod was where I started it all. I wouldn't then play GMod regularly at all up until the start of lockdown when I started to pick it up again.</p>
							<u>Lockdown and learning to code</u>
							<p>During lockdown, when I started to pick up Garry's Mod again, I started really getting into the game mode of 'DarkRP'. After playing this game mode on multiple different servers for hundreds of hours, I decided I wanted my own personalised version and not what other servers were making. So, I started to learn how to run GMod servers until I realised, once I had a server up and running, it was just an empty world. This then promted me into starting to learn the coding language of LUA to be able to start implementing addons into the server. After spending the majority of my lockdown learning how to code in LUA for GMod as well as making and releasing multiple different GMod servers that were getting hundreds of daily players, I decided that coding and games development was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.</p>
