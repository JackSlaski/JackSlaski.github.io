							<h2>Final Year Dissertation</h2>
							<p>
								In modern-day games, using complex user interfaces (UIs) to display large amounts of information has become increasingly more common. UIs of this nature can cause a multitude of issues for user experience (UX), such as cognitive overload and a reduction in player immersion. This study investigates how minimalist design can improve player immersion by lowering the player's visual clutter and distractions. The research conducted in this paper focuses on how established UI and UX theories, concepts, and principles, such as Fitts's Law, Hick's Law, and the Gestalt Principles of Perception, can guide the development of effective minimalist interfaces in video games. In order to determine the best practices for designing user-friendly and engaging interfaces, a thorough literature review on UI/UX was carried out.

								Furthermore, a review of existing game UIs was also conducted in order to understand common design flaws, pitfalls, and effective techniques that are frequent in popular video game titles. Based on the research conducted in the study's literature review, two minimalist UI interfaces were created in Unreal Engine 5's (UE5) UMG system. The effectiveness of these iterative designs was then assessed using qualitative user perception testing, in which participants evaluated the two UI versions' clarity, usability, and ability to provide an immersive experience, with the second UI version being developed based on the feedback and suggestions gathered from the survey results. The overall findings in this study revealed that the second UI iteration was seen as more effective for enhancing player immersion, reducing cognitive load, and improving clarity. Participants stated that adjustments such as clearer visual hierarchy, improved feedback mechanisms, and the removal of unnecessary elements resulted in a more intuitive experience overall. These results align with established UI and UX theories, which support the effectiveness of minimalistic design in improving user engagement and immersion in video games.
